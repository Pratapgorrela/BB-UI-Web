|---|---|---|
| 01 | Scaffold Vite + React + TypeScript app | `[x]` |
| 02 | Install all dependencies (React Router, React Query, Zustand, RHF, Zod, Axios, Lucide, date-fns, Tailwind, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest) | `[x]` |
| 03 | Configure Tailwind with design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows, z-index, breakpoints) | `[x]` |
| 04 | Create folder structure from architecture.md | `[x]` |
| 05 | Create apiClient with VITE_USE_MOCKS toggle | `[x]` |

| 09 | Verify npm run build passes | `[x]` |
| 10 | Initial commit: F0, Step 10 — Project scaffold complete | `[x]` |

---

## F1 — Design System

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | Align Tailwind tokens with Figma — verify color scales, typography, spacing match designer's flows; update design.md + index.css | `[x]` |
| 12 | Implement typography tokens (font families, type scale, weights) + spacing, radii, shadows, z-index, motion tokens in Tailwind config | `[x]` |
| 13 | Build Button component (all variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost, danger; sizes: sm, md, lg; states: default, hover, focus, disabled, loading) | `[x]` |
| 14 | Build Input component (variants: default, error, disabled; with label, helper text, error message) + Select/Dropdown + Textarea | `[x]` |
| 15 | Build Card component (variants: default, raised, interactive) | `[x]` |
| 16 | Build Badge/Chip component (variants: default, primary, success, warning, danger, info) + discount badge ("20% OFF") | `[x]` |
| 17 | Build Modal/BottomSheet component (mobile: bottom sheet; desktop: centered modal; focus trap, backdrop) | `[x]` |
| 18 | Build Toast/notification component (variants: success, error, info, warning; auto-dismiss, swipe-to-dismiss) | `[x]` |
| 19 | Build Skeleton component (for loading states — line, circle, card, rectangle variants) | `[x]` |
| 20 | Build Avatar component (sizes: sm, md, lg; image + initials fallback on primary-100/primary-700) | `[x]` |

| 22 | Build Toggle/Switch component (on/off states, purple active color — per Figma notification settings) | `[x]` |
| 23 | Build FAQ Accordion component (expand/collapse, chevron icon — per Figma Help & Support) | `[x]` |
| 24a | Build StickyBottomBar component (cart icon + price + "Continue" CTA — per Figma cart/service detail) | `[x]` |
| 24b | Create /dev/components demo page showing all UI primitives with all variants | `[x]` |

> **Step 11** — Figma designs received 2026-06-28. Ready to align tokens.

## F2 — App Shell & Navigation

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | Build AppShell layout component (wraps pages, handles nav switching) | `[x]` |
| 26 | Build BottomNav component (mobile, 64px, 5 items: Home, Services, Bookings, Alerts, Profile — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 27 | Build TopNav/Header component (desktop, 64px, logo, nav links, auth actions) | `[x]` |
| 28 | Implement responsive nav switching at 768px breakpoint | `[x]` |
| 29 | Build Container component (max-width 1200px, responsive padding) | `[x]` |
| 30 | Build PageHeader component (← back arrow + title — per Figma pattern) | `[x]` |
| 31 | Integrate shell with router — all pages wrapped in AppShell | `[x]` |

> **F2 complete (2026-07-12).** Verified at 375/768/1024/1440px with 30 automated browser checks — responsive nav switch at 768px, active-tab highlighting on nested routes, a11y (aria-current, focus rings, 44px targets), zero console errors. Auth pages render without nav via route `handle: { hideNav }`; `/dev/components` opts out via `fullBleed`. Also fixed a latent Tailwind v4 token bug (`z-sticky` was a no-op; project z tokens are `--z-*`, so utilities must use `z-(--z-sticky)`).

---

## F3 — Home / Landing

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 32 | Lock Service Catalog contract section (if not already locked for F4) | `[x]` |
| 33 | Intel Report for F3 — wait for approval | `[x]` |
| 34 | Build greeting header section ("Hello" + address selector + cart icon with badge — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 35 | Build search bar component (navigates to search page) | `[x]` |
| 36 | Build category grid section (Men, Women, Kids, Seniors, Bride, Groom — 2-col grid with purple gradient cards + images — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 37 | Build "Popular Combos" section (horizontal scroll cards — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 38 | Build "Offers for You" section (promo cards carousel — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 39 | Build testimonials section ("What Our Customers Say" — review cards with avatar, stars, quote — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 40 | Build referral section ("Share the Beauty, Get Rewarded" — CTA card — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 41 | Build floating Support button (green FAB — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 42 | Compose HomePage with all sections, 4 data states, responsive layout | `[x]` |

> **F3 complete (2026-07-13).** Built the Home screen Figma-exact from the user's reference. **New LOCKED "Home & Promotions" contract section** added (Rule 1): `Offer`, `Testimonial`, `Referral` entities + guest endpoints `GET /offers`, `/testimonials`, `/referral` — the three editorial sections had no prior contract/mock. `Testimonial` is deliberately distinct from the per-service `Review` (F10). New `src/features/home/` feature (types → Zod → api → hooks → components) with `src/mocks/{data,handlers}` for the three endpoints (`?scenario=error|empty` triggers mirror the catalog `FORCE_500` convention). **Reused** `CategoryCard`, `ServiceCard`, `useFetchCategories`/`useFetchServices`, `DataState`, `Avatar`, `Card`, `Button`, `formatPrice`, toasts. Sections: greeting header (mobile-only, `md:hidden` — TopNav covers desktop), search bar → `/services` (interim "CTA to catalog"; **F14 repoints to `/search`**), 6-category grid (reused CategoryCard), Popular Combos (`type=COMBO&isPopular=true`, horizontal ServiceCard row), Offers carousel (DARK/PRIMARY themes), testimonials (scroll-snap carousel + dot nav, no new pkg — Rule 10), referral CTA (₹100/₹100 from data). Small backward-compatible reuse tweak: added optional `onOpen` to `ServiceCard` (mirrors `ServiceListItem`) so combo cards tap through to detail while `+` stays separate. **Decisions:** Support FAB is **purple** per the Figma reference — *deviates from design.md line 14 (green FAB)*; cart badge is **hidden at count 0** (no cart until F13); the van "Arriving in 10 min" card is **deferred to F15 Track Van** (no tracking data/contract yet). Cart/search/support taps use the established "coming soon" toast/navigate stubs. Verified: typecheck + `vite build` clean; **30/30 Vitest** (20 existing + 10 new promotions: offers/testimonials/referral happy + `scenario=error`→500 + `scenario=empty`→empty + seed↔schema integrity); **32/32 browser checks** (scratchpad Playwright) covering all 8 sections in Figma order, category→`/categories/:slug` + combo→`/services/:id` navigation, search/cart/support stubs, purple FAB, hidden-at-0 cart badge, loading skeletons, mobile header shown@375 / hidden@768+, zero horizontal overflow @375/768/1024/1440, zero console errors. **Caveat:** `npm run lint` still fails repo-wide (pre-existing — ESLint flat config never created; blocked on `typescript-eslint` package approval per Rule 10). Imagery (offers, testimonials) stays picsum until real assets drop into the same `imageUrl` fields.

## F4 — Service Catalog

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 43 | Lock Service Catalog contract section | `[x]` |
| 44 | Intel Report for F4 — wait for approval | `[x]` |
| 45 | Create Service, ServiceCategory types + Zod schemas | `[x]` |
| 46 | Create mock data (12+ services, 6 categories: Men/Women/Kids/Seniors/Bride/Groom, combo + single services) + mock handlers | `[x]` |
| 47 | Create API layer functions (fetchServices, fetchCategories) | `[x]` |
| 48 | Create React Query hooks (useFetchServices, useFetchCategories) with query keys | `[x]` |
| 49 | Build ServiceCard component (image + name + description + price + "+" add button — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 50 | Build CategoryDetailPage (hero image, category name/description, Combos section, Single Services section — per Figma Men Services) | `[x]` |
| 51 | Build category filter bar | `[x]` |
| 52 | Build search + sort controls | `[x]` |
| 53 | Compose ServiceCatalogPage — category grid, filter, search, 4 data states, responsive | `[x]` |

> **F4 complete (2026-07-13).** Contract amended to the Figma combo model before locking (`type` COMBO/SINGLE, `originalPrice`/`discountPercent`/`includedServiceIds`, `heroImageUrl`, `type` query param, INR). 34 seed services across 6 categories (Seniors deliberately has no combos → exercises the empty Combos section). New route `/categories/:slug` → CategoryDetailPage; `/services/:id` stays reserved for F5. ServiceCard "+" shows a "Cart is coming soon" toast — real cart lands in F13. **Fixed a latent mockEngine bug**: the axios adapter ignored `config.params`, so any GET with query params (all catalog filters) would have silently returned unfiltered data; also added a `paginated()` envelope helper. Verified: typecheck + build clean; 17 Vitest integration tests through the real mock adapter (envelopes, pagination math, all filters, sorting, FORCE_500, validation errors, seed↔schema integrity); **37/37 automated browser checks** (scratchpad Playwright harness) covering skeletons, 4 data states, chip/search/sort/pagination with URL params, cart toast, Men/Seniors/unknown-slug detail pages, grid columns 1→2→3→4 and zero horizontal overflow at 375/768/1024/1440px, zero console errors on happy paths + `[Catalog]`-prefixed error logging on failure. **Caveat**: `npm run lint` fails repo-wide (pre-existing — ESLint 10 flat config never created; needs `typescript-eslint`, blocked on package approval per Rule 10).

> **F4 design revision (2026-07-13, post-review).** User compared `/services` against Figma 184:4383 and supplied the final card artwork as `public/{Kids,Seniors,Men,Women,Bride,Groom}.png` (182×157). Page recomposed **Figma-exact**: header "Our Services" + subtitle + 6 image cards with centered labels *below* the card; category seeds now point at the local PNGs. The on-page "All services" browser (chips, search, sort, paginated list) was removed per user decision — `CategoryFilterBar`/`CatalogControls`/`CatalogPagination` stay exported from the feature barrel for F14 Search (step 143 reuse). Services are browsed via category detail pages. Re-verified: typecheck/build clean, 17/17 Vitest, **20/20 browser checks** (Figma copy/order/assets, labels below images, browsing UI absent, detail-page click-through, 2/3/6 grid columns + zero overflow at 375/768/1440). Note: PNGs are 1× — consider re-exporting at 2× for high-DPI phones (same filenames, no code change). Also reduced the category card corner radius to 12px (`rounded-lg`) per user request.

> **F4 category-detail revision (2026-07-13).** User supplied the Figma "Men Services" target; `/categories/:slug` recomposed to an **immersive** layout (user decisions: keep picsum placeholder imagery for now; hide nav). Route now carries `handle: { hideNav: true, fullBleed: true }`. [CategoryDetailPage](../src/pages/CategoryDetailPage.tsx) = full-bleed hero (`heroImageUrl` + gradient scrim + faded category-name watermark + floating white back button → `/services`) over a rounded content sheet (`-mt-6 rounded-t-3xl`) with `<h1>` + subtitle, then **Combos** and **Single services** as horizontal list rows. New [`ServiceListItem`](../src/features/service-catalog/components/ServiceListItem.tsx) component (thumbnail · name + `DiscountBadge` · one-line desc · price · grey `+`) replaces the vertical `ServiceCard` grid on this page; **`ServiceCard` stays exported, parked for F3 Home**. Verified: typecheck/build clean, 17/17 Vitest, **16/16 browser checks** (hero to top, no nav, back→/services, 4 combos with "20% OFF" + 6 singles without, ₹ prices, empty combos on Seniors, zero overflow at 375/1440, zero console errors). Imagery stays picsum until the user drops real assets into the same `imageUrl`/`heroImageUrl` fields.

## F5 — Service Details

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 54 | Intel Report for F5 — wait for approval | `[x]` |
| 55 | Create mock data for service detail + recommended add-ons + mock handlers | `[x]` |
| 56 | Create API layer (fetchService) + hooks | `[x]` |
| 57 | Build ServiceDetailPage (large image, name, duration, price with strikethrough + discount badge, description, check icon, recommended add-ons — per Figma Sub Services) | `[x]` |
| 58 | Build "Recommended" add-ons section (image cards with "Add" button — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 59 | Build sticky bottom CTA bar (cart icon + price + service count + duration + "Continue" button — per Figma) | `[x]` |
| 60 | 4 data states + responsive layout for service detail page | `[x]` |

> **F5 complete (2026-07-13).** `GET /services/:id` added to the LOCKED Service Catalog contract's mock layer (found → single-resource envelope; unknown id → 404 `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`; reserved id `FORCE_500` → 500, mirroring the `/services` search convention). New `fetchService(id)` + `useFetchService(id)` hook (reuses the pre-existing `catalogKeys.service(id)`). No new seed data or entities — the 34 F4 services already carry every detail field; **no Specialist work** (the Figma-driven steps 54–60 cover detail + add-ons + sticky CTA, not specialist lists). [ServiceDetailPage](../src/pages/ServiceDetailPage.tsx) rebuilt from the placeholder as an **immersive** page (route `handle: { hideNav: true, fullBleed: true }`): full-bleed `imageUrl` hero + scrim + floating back button (`navigate(-1)`), rounded content sheet with name + price (effective price, strikethrough `originalPrice`, `DiscountBadge`, duration via `formatDuration`, rating/reviewCount), description, a combo-only **"What's included"** check-list, a **"Recommended"** add-ons section (reused `ServiceListItem` rows), and the reused `StickyBottomBar` ("Add to cart" CTA → "Cart is coming soon" toast; real cart is F13). Included/recommended are derived client-side from one same-category `GET /services` query — **no invented contract field** (combo→`includedServiceIds`; single→other same-category singles, capped at 6). **Navigation wired**: `ServiceListItem` gained an optional `onOpen` so tapping a row (not the `+`) opens the detail page — used from `CategoryDetailPage`; nothing linked to `/services/:id` before. **4 data states**: 404 is routed to the empty state (not-found + "Browse services" CTA) via `getApiError().code`, so only real failures show the error/retry UI. Verified: typecheck + `vite build` clean; **20/20 Vitest** (17 existing + 3 new detail-endpoint tests: found/404/FORCE_500); **21/21 browser checks** (category→row→detail click-through, combo strikethrough+"20% OFF"+included list, single plain price, unknown-id not-found, FORCE_500 error+retry, sticky CTA toast, immersive no-nav, zero horizontal overflow @ 375/768/1024/1440, zero console errors). **Caveat**: `npm run lint` still fails repo-wide (pre-existing — ESLint 10 flat config never created; Rule 10 package approval pending). Imagery stays picsum until real assets drop into the same `imageUrl` fields.

> **F5 design revision (2026-07-13, post-review).** User asked to reduce font sizes and corner radius on the detail view. One-notch reduction applied to **both** immersive detail pages ([ServiceDetailPage](../src/pages/ServiceDetailPage.tsx) + [CategoryDetailPage](../src/pages/CategoryDetailPage.tsx)) for consistency: titles `text-h2`→`text-h3` (24→20px), price `text-h3`→`text-h4` (20→18px), section headings `text-h3`→`text-h4` (20→18px), description/list items `text-body`→`text-body-sm` (16→14px), content-sheet top corner `rounded-t-3xl`→`rounded-t-xl` (24→16px, project token scale). Re-verified: typecheck + build clean, 21/21 browser checks still pass.

---

## F6 — Auth (Login & Signup)

> **Note:** Login/Signup screens are not in the Figma file. Build using brand design language (purple primary, clean form layout, Poppins headings).

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 61 | Lock Auth contract section | `[x]` |
| 62 | Intel Report for F6 — wait for approval | `[x]` |
| 63 | Create User type, auth request/response types + Zod schemas | `[x]` |
| 64 | Create mock data (test users) + mock handlers (register, login, refresh, logout, me) | `[x]` |
| 65 | Create auth API layer functions | `[x]` |
| 66 | Create useAuthStore (Zustand — token, user, isAuthenticated, login/logout actions) | `[x]` |
| 67 | Inject auth header into apiClient from store | `[x]` |
| 68 | Build LoginPage with form (RHF + Zod — email + password, per locked contract) | `[x]` |
| 69 | Build RegisterPage with form (RHF + Zod — name, email, phone, password) | `[x]` |
| 70 | Build ProtectedRoute wrapper component | `[x]` |
| 71 | Wire auth pages into router, test full flow in mock mode | `[x]` |

> **F6 complete (2026-07-12).** Email+password auth per locked contract (login is email-only — contract is canonical over the earlier "phone/email" step wording). Built the real mock engine this feature: custom axios adapter in `src/mocks/lib/mockEngine.ts` (no MSW — Rule 10), 300–600ms latency, envelope-exact responses, localStorage-persisted sessions with refresh-token rotation. apiClient now injects Bearer tokens and does single-flight refresh-on-401 with retry. Seeded logins: priya@example.com / Priya@123, rahul@example.com / Rahul@123; error@test.com forces a 500 on register. ProtectedRoute guards /bookings, /book, /profile, /notifications with returnTo. TopNav is auth-aware. ProfilePage is a minimal F6 test surface (avatar + user + logout via /auth/me) — F9 rebuilds it fully. Verified: 20 automated browser checks (bad creds 401, duplicate 409, forced 500, returnTo, token refresh rotation, logout, mobile 375px), zero console errors. Also fixed latent `z-toast` no-op in Toast.tsx and mounted ToastProvider app-wide.

## F7 — Booking Flow (integrated with checkout)

> **Scope revised 2026-07-13 (user decision):** no standalone `/book` stepper — the original steps 72–86 predated Figma/F13. Scheduling integrates into checkout: "Add Slot" opens an in-app-designed date + time-slot picker (no Figma screen exists — brand language), a slot is required before placing the order, and `POST /bookings` supersedes `POST /orders` so checkout creates a real scheduled Booking (F8 gets real data). Specialists are system-assigned (no picker — matches Figma). The old step 73 (lock Profile & Addresses) is consciously dropped — checkout keeps the interim `checkoutAddresses` until F9.

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 72 | Amend & lock Availability & Booking contract (capacity slots by date, Booking carries items, POST /bookings supersedes POST /orders) + change-log entries + this checklist rewrite | `[x]` |
| 73 | Intel Report for F7 — wait for approval | `[ ]` |
| 74 | Create TimeSlot, Booking, Specialist types + Zod schemas (`src/features/booking/types/`) | `[ ]` |
| 75 | Create specialist seed data for auto-assignment (`src/mocks/data/specialists.data.ts`) | `[ ]` |
| 76 | Mock handlers: GET /time-slots (deterministic grid + scenario triggers) + POST /bookings (auth, pricing reuse, auto-assign, `bb-mock-bookings` persistence, 409) + shared `requireAuth` guard extraction | `[ ]` |
| 77 | Vitest integration tests for booking handlers (happy, 400, 401, 422, 409, persistence, seed↔schema integrity) | `[ ]` |
| 78 | Booking API layer + React Query hooks (`fetchTimeSlots`/`createBooking`, `bookingKeys`, `useFetchTimeSlots`, `useCreateBooking`) — no new store; slot selection is checkout-local state | `[ ]` |
| 79 | Build DateStrip component (next-14-days chips — first date-fns use) | `[ ]` |
| 80 | Build TimeSlotGrid component (morning/afternoon/evening pill groups, unavailable/selected states) | `[ ]` |
| 81 | Build SlotPickerSheet (reused Modal bottom sheet + DataState 4 states + confirm footer) | `[ ]` |
| 82 | Build SelectedSlotCard + integrate into CheckoutPage (replaces the dashed "Add slot" button; slot required before placing order) | `[ ]` |
| 83 | Swap order placement → `useCreateBooking`; SLOT_UNAVAILABLE 409 recovery (clear slot, refetch, reopen picker) | `[ ]` |
| 84 | BookingConfirmationPage (rename `/order-confirmation` → `/booking-confirmation`; reference, schedule, items, total, "View my bookings") | `[ ]` |
| 85 | Retire the superseded order path (Order type/schema, placeOrder API, usePlaceOrder, POST /orders handler + tests) and the `/book` placeholder (BookingFlowPage, route) | `[ ]` |
| 86 | 4 data states + responsive 375–1440 verification (Vitest suite + browser checks) | `[ ]` |

---

## F8 — My Bookings

> **F7 hand-off (2026-07-13):** `Booking` now carries `items[]` + `paymentSummary` (multi-service — booking cards should render the items snapshot); the reschedule UI (step 95) should reuse F7's `SlotPickerSheet`; F8 owns the mock handlers for `GET /bookings`, `GET /bookings/:id`, reschedule, and cancel (contract already LOCKED). Created bookings persist in localStorage `bb-mock-bookings`.

| Step | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 87 | Intel Report for F8 — wait for approval | `[ ]` |
| 88 | Create mock data (bookings in all statuses) + mock handlers (list, detail, cancel, reschedule) | `[ ]` |
| 89 | Create booking list/detail API layer + hooks | `[ ]` |
| 90 | Build BookingCard component (service image, name, ID, date, estimated time, category — per Figma) | `[ ]` |
| 91 | Build MyBookingsPage with 3 tabs: Upcoming / Past / Cancelled (per Figma) | `[ ]` |
| 92 | Build BookingDetailPage (service info, ID, date, time, address, services list, payment summary link, action buttons — per Figma) | `[ ]` |
| 93 | Build action buttons per status: Track Van + Reschedule + Rebook + Cancel (active), Payment Summary only (completed) — per Figma | `[ ]` |
| 94 | Build cancel flow (confirmation modal, 2h business rule, reason input) | `[ ]` |
| 95 | Build reschedule flow (new time slot selection) | `[ ]` |
| 96 | 4 data states + responsive for all booking management pages | `[ ]` |

## F9 — Profile & Addresses

| Step | Task | Status |

| 139e | Addendum: entrance animations (`--animate-*` @theme tokens), Modal z-index fix, verification — 49/49 Vitest + 49/49 browser checks, responsive, reduced motion | `[x]` |

> **F13 complete (2026-07-13).** New **LOCKED "Cart & Checkout" contract section** (Rule 1): `CartItem`, `Coupon`, `PaymentSummary`, `Order` entities + `GET /coupons`, `POST /checkout/summary`, `POST /orders`. **Hybrid state model** (user decision): the cart is client-state in a persisted `useCartStore` (`bb-cart` — guest-friendly, survives refresh, `addItem`/`removeItem`/`updateQuantity`/`toggleSelected`/`clearCart` + `cartItemCount`/`cartSubtotal`/`selectedCartItems`/`cartSelectedDuration` selectors); coupons + payment math are **server-authoritative** via the mock (`priceCart` recomputes serviceCharges from seed, applies PERCENT/FLAT coupons with `minSubtotal`/`maxDiscount`, 18% GST). New `src/features/cart/` feature (types → Zod → api → hooks → components → barrel) + `src/mocks/{data/cart.data.ts (4 coupons), handlers/cart.mock.ts}`. **Checkout terminates at a mock order** (user decision): `POST /orders` (auth-guarded, mirrors the auth token guard) returns an `Order` with a `BB-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` reference; scheduling ("Add Slot") is **deferred to F7** with a toast. Pages: `CartPage` (`/cart`, guest-allowed), `CheckoutPage` (`/checkout`, inside `<ProtectedRoute>`), `OrderConfirmationPage` (`/order-confirmation`). **Activated every dead "add to cart" button** — Home combos, `ServiceDetailPage` (sticky + recommended), `CategoryDetailPage` rows now call `useCartStore.addItem` with a success toast; `HomeHeader` cart icon → `/cart` with live badge (wired from `HomePage`); **new cart icon + badge added to desktop `TopNav`** (had none). **Reused** `StickyBottomBar` (+ small backward-compatible `priceLabel` prop for ₹ output — mirrors the F5 approach), `Card`, `Button`, `DiscountBadge`, `TextInput`, `Avatar`, `DataState`, `Skeleton`, `useToast`, `formatPrice`/`formatDuration`. **New components:** `CartItemCard`, `PaymentSummaryCard` (expandable), `CouponSection`, `AddressSelect`. Coupon rejection is handled without `useEffect` — the summary is a `keepPreviousData` query, so a bad coupon shows an inline error while the last good breakdown stays on screen; Place order is disabled until it's fixed. **Addresses are interim** (`checkoutAddresses` static list) pending F9 (Profile & Addresses, DRAFT) — hand-off noted in the file. Verified: typecheck + `vite build` clean; **45/45 Vitest** (30 existing + 15 new cart: coupon list happy/`scenario=empty`/`error`, summary math + FLAT/capped-PERCENT coupons + `minSubtotal` 422 + unknown coupon/service 400 + empty-items 400, order 401-without-token/201-with-token/coupon-through-order, seed↔schema integrity); **29/29 browser checks** (scratchpad Playwright) covering add-from-Home→badge, cart select/qty/empty states, guest→/login redirect, authenticated checkout, FLAT100 apply + BIG50 gated-rejection, place order→confirmation with reference code, cart cleared, `[Cart]`-prefixed handled-error logging on the deliberate rejection, zero unexpected console errors, zero horizontal overflow @ 375/768/1024/1440, desktop TopNav cart link. Screenshots captured (cart/checkout/confirmation). **Caveat:** `npm run lint` still fails repo-wide (pre-existing — ESLint flat config never created; Rule 10 package approval pending). Imagery stays picsum until real assets drop into the same `imageUrl` fields.

> **F13 addendum — details bottom sheet + sticky cart bar (2026-07-13, per the user's Figma popup mockups + BB.mp4 gap analysis; client-only, contract untouched).** Category rows (`/categories/:slug`) now open the service's **full details in a bottom sheet** instead of navigating: new `ServiceDetailSheet` (hero with overlaid purple `DiscountBadge` — new backward-compatible `variant` pass-through —, strikethrough price row, `Duration - {x}` line, description with floating **+ → purple ✓ toggle** [user decision: tapping ✓ removes], combo "Plan includes" / single "Recommended" labeled-thumbnail mini-cards with Add⟷Added toggles, static "Self-Care Sundays" promo banner) rendered in the reused `Modal` (new backward-compatible `padded={false}` + `ariaLabel` props + the app's **first real entrance animations**: `--animate-fade-in`/`--animate-slide-up`/`--animate-rise` `@theme` tokens per design.md's spring spec; **fixed latent Modal bug**: root `z-modal` was a no-op class in this Tailwind v4 setup → `z-(--z-modal)`). Sheet state is **URL-driven** (`?service=<id>` via new `useServiceSheetParam` hook — first `useSearchParams` use in the app): browser/Android **back closes the sheet**, deep links restore it; opening pushes `state.sheet` so close = `navigate(-1)` in-app or replace-clear on deep links, with `preventScrollReset`. **Sticky cart summary bar** (reused `StickyBottomBar` + new backward-compatible `subtitle` / `position: 'sticky'` props) appears whenever the cart is non-empty: a page-level fixed bar (`animate-rise`) AND a `position="sticky"` instance inside the sheet (a11y: the bar must live inside the `aria-modal` dialog to stay reachable); badge = `cartItemCount`, subtitle = `"{first} +N more"`, Continue → `/cart`. Extracted `deriveServiceRelations` into `features/service-catalog/utils/` (now shared with `ServiceDetailPage` — behavior identical) + new pure `isInCart` selector in `useCartStore`. Row "+" quick-add is unchanged (inline qty stepper = remaining video gap #2); Home and `/services/:id` are unchanged (user decision: popup on category pages only). Verified: typecheck + build clean, **49/49 Vitest** (45 + 4 new in `serviceRelations.test.ts`), **49/49 browser checks** (open/close via Escape/backdrop/back/deep-link/invalid-id, ✓ add/remove toggle, mini-card Added state, badge counts, Continue→cart, scroll preservation, responsive 375–1440 with no overflow, sheet ≤480px centered on desktop, reduced-motion, zero unexpected console errors) + 3 screenshots.

## Merge Log

| Date | Branch | Feature | Steps | Merged By |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Conflict Resolution Rules

1. **Checklist entries**: keep ALL entries from both branches — never delete another feature's progress markers.
2. **Mock seed data**: merge data from both branches, deduplicate by `id`.
3. **Component files**: review both changes, combine functionality logically.
4. **Never force-push**: no `git push --force` or `git push -f` under any circumstances.
5. **Re-verify after resolving**: always re-run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run build` after resolving conflicts.
